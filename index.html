      <p>My name is Robert Sanchez, and I am in the process of switching careers from Social Work to Software Engineer.<br>
        I trust that my personal story, work history and ethics makes me a perfect candidate to make this transition and permit me to<br>
        be part of a company that will allow me to affect change as I believe being a Software Engineer will do.</p><a href="contact-me.html">Contact Me</a></td>
